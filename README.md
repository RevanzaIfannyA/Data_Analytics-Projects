# ðŸ“Š Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I am a Bachelor of Actuarial Science with a strong interest in data analysis and problem solving. Through self-directed learning, I have developed hands-on experience in working with data using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), MySQL, Power BI, and Excel.

In this portfolio, you will find a collection of self-initiated projects that reflect my ability to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data to derive actionable insights. These projects demonstrate not only my technical skills, but also my passion for turning raw data into meaningful stories that can support data-driven decision making.

You will also find examples of dashboards and visual reports created using Power BI and Excel, showcasing my ability to present data in a clear and impactful way. Each project is documented in detail, with explanations of the problem, approach, and key findings.

In addition to my technical abilities, I bring an analytical mindset and a continuous learning attitude. I strive to grow through every project I take on, and I am always looking for better ways to ask questions, explore data, and communicate insights.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. I hope you find it informative and engaging.
