# ðŸš€ E-Commerce Data Analysis | mySQL â†’ Power BI
## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data using **mySQL** for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation, combined with **Power BI** for building interactive dashboards and insightful visualizations.  
The analysis aims to uncover sales trends, evaluate top and bottom-performing products, monitor profit margins, assess discount effectiveness, and identify key cities driving revenue.  

The dataset used in this project comes from [Kaggle - E-Commerce Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrishtimanja/ecommerce-dataset-for-data-analysis?) and has been processed to meet the business requirements.  
By leveraging these tools and techniques, the project provides actionable insights that can support data-driven decision-making and improve business performance.
## ðŸ“Š Dataset Explanation

This dataset contains **55,000 synthetic customer transactions**, generated using Python's **Faker** library.  
It is designed as a learning resource for exploring, analyzing, and applying various **data analysis techniques** in a context that closely mimics real-world data.

âš  **Note:**  
This is a **synthetic dataset** created solely for learning purposes using Python's Faker library.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- **MySQL** â€“ Used for data cleaning, transformation, and querying directly from the database.
- **Power BI** â€“ Used for building interactive dashboards, connecting directly to the MySQL database, and applying minor adjustments using Power Query.

## Business Requirements

This project focuses on delivering insights into e-commerce performance by tracking and analyzing key business metrics (KPIs) such as:

- **Total Transactions** â€“ How many unique transactions were recorded in the dataset?  
- **Total Revenue** â€“ What is the total gross revenue and total net revenue?  
- **Average Net Amount per Transaction** â€“ What is the average revenue generated from each transaction?  
- **Total Unique Customers** â€“ How many distinct customers made purchases?

## ðŸ“Œ Workflow / Methodology

The project follows a straightforward yet effective workflow to transform raw data into actionable dashboards:

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Download the dataset from Kaggle: [E-Commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/superstore-marketing-campaign-dataset)  
   - Store the dataset in MySQL database for further processing.

2. **Data Cleaning (MySQL)**  
   - Check each column for blank values.  
   - Replace any blank values with `NULL` to standardize missing data representation.  
   - Ensure data types are consistent across columns.

3. **Querying & KPI Preparation (MySQL)**  
   - Write SQL queries to extract metrics and aggregated data needed for analysis.  
   - Validate query outputs against the raw dataset to ensure accuracy.

4. **Data Connection & Light Adjustments (Power Query)**  
   - Connect Power BI directly to the MySQL database.  
   - Perform minor adjustments such as column renaming, filtering, and type conversions.

5. **Data Visualization (Power BI)**  
   - Build interactive dashboards and visualizations based on KPIs.  
   - Apply drill-down, slicers, and filters for dynamic analysis.  
   - Design intuitive layouts for better readability.

6. **Dashboard Export**  
   - Export the completed dashboard to PDF format for sharing and documentation.
