# ðŸš€ E-Commerce Data Analysis | mySQL â†’ Power BI
## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data using **mySQL** for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation, combined with **Power BI** for building interactive dashboards and insightful visualizations.  
The analysis aims to uncover sales trends, evaluate top and bottom-performing products, monitor profit margins, assess discount effectiveness, and identify key cities driving revenue.  

The dataset used in this project comes from [Kaggle - E-Commerce Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrishtimanja/ecommerce-dataset-for-data-analysis?) and has been processed to meet the business requirements.  
By leveraging these tools and techniques, the project provides actionable insights that can support data-driven decision-making and improve business performance.
## ðŸ“Š Dataset Explanation

This dataset contains **55,000 synthetic customer transactions**, generated using Python's **Faker** library.  
It is designed as a learning resource for exploring, analyzing, and applying various **data analysis techniques** in a context that closely mimics real-world data.

âš  **Note:**  
This is a **synthetic dataset** created solely for learning purposes using Python's Faker library.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- **MySQL** â€“ Used for data cleaning, transformation, and querying directly from the database.
- **Power BI** â€“ Used for building interactive dashboards, connecting directly to the MySQL database, and applying minor adjustments using Power Query.

## Business Requirements

This project focuses on delivering insights into e-commerce performance by tracking and analyzing key business metrics (KPIs) such as:

- **Total Transactions** â€“ How many unique transactions were recorded in the dataset?  
- **Total Revenue** â€“ What is the total gross revenue and total net revenue?  
- **Average Net Amount per Transaction** â€“ What is the average revenue generated from each transaction?  
- **Total Unique Customers** â€“ How many distinct customers made purchases?
